Headless Mocha (without browser)
=====================

A simple Boilerplate to use [Mocha][mocha] test framework as a Headless front-end tool on top of [Zombie][zombie] (FYI it's not a cross-browser approach but helps towards the TDD development process)

### Before the first test
`npm install`

### Default test spec (written on Makefile)
`make test`

### Test example
Take a look at test/[homepageTest.js][example]
